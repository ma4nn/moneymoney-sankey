## Installation

This MoneyMoney extension must be installed as follows:
1. In the MoneyMoney app open menu Help → Show database in Finder
2. Copy the `SankeyChart.lua` from the [release](https://github.com/ma4nn/moneymoney-sankey/releases) file into that folder.

## Usage

The Sankey Chart can be generated by selecting or filtering the appropriate transactions or accounts in MoneyMoney and choose menu Account → Export Transactions.  
Afterwards choose "Sankey Chart (.html)" as the export format and open the generated file in your browser of choice.
